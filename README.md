# Keylogger
This is a Python program that logs every keystroke on the keyboard and saves it to a log file. The program uses the pynput library to monitor and record the keystrokes.

## Prerequisites
This program requires Python 3 and the pynput library to be installed on your system. You can install the pynput library using pip by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pynput
```
## How to use
Download the keylogger.py file and save it in your desired directory.

Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where keylogger.py is saved.

Run the program by executing the command:

```bash
python keylogger.py
```
The program will start running and will record every keystroke on the keyboard.

The log file will be saved in the same directory as keylogger.py with the name keyLog.txt.

To stop the program, press Ctrl + C in the command prompt or terminal.

## Security Considerations
This program can be used for both legal and illegal purposes. While it can be used to monitor the activity of children or employees, it can also be used to steal sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers. As such, it is important to use this program responsibly and only on systems that you have the legal authority to monitor. Additionally, it is recommended to use antivirus software and a firewall to prevent the log file from being transmitted to an unauthorized person.
